# Module-3-Challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with completing the rest of the password generator. The generator had all the styles and design but didn't function. My job was to make it work like a password generator. I added the code needed to make the prompts pop up on the screen when you click "Generate Password". It will ask for the length of your password, if you want lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. After you click through all the prompts, your password is generated. You can also say no to the prompts you don't want and the password generator won't include it. It's also designed for mobile use. 

Code source was provided by instructor in the develop folder. Code is also located in the main branch of the repository inside the index file.
